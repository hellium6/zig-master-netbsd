Zig is an open-source programming language designed for robustness,
optimality, and clarity.

* Robust - behavior is correct even for edge cases such as out
  of memory.
* Optimal - write programs the best way they can
  behave and perform.
* Clear - precisely communicate your intent
  to the compiler and other programmers. The language imposes a
  low overhead to reading code.

(This modified package installs in a different prefix than usual:
${PREFIX}/zig-${PKGVERSION_NOREV} which might be something like:
/usr/pkg/zig-0.14.0)
