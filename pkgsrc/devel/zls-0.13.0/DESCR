The Zig Language Server (ZLS) is a tool that implements
Microsoft's Language Server Protocol for Zig in Zig.
In simpler terms: it'll provide you with completions,
go-to definition, etc. when you write Zig code!

(This modified package installs in a different prefix than usual which
might be something like: /usr/pkg/zig-0.14.0)
